# Silent Bridge: Real-Time Sign Language Translation  

**Tagline:**  
"Bridging Silence with Technology â€“ Transforming Gestures into Words."  

---

## Project Overview  
**Silent Bridge** is an innovative real-time web application designed to empower communication between deaf/mute individuals and the hearing world. Developed as a final project for Grade 12 Computer Science, this application uses cutting-edge AI and machine learning to classify hand gestures and translate them into text and speech. With its intuitive design and advanced features, **Silent Bridge** aims to break down communication barriers and foster inclusivity.

## Key Features  

### Real-Time Gesture Recognition  
- Powered by **TensorFlow**, the app accurately classifies hand gestures in real-time, even in challenging lighting conditions.  
- Supports dynamic gesture mapping, allowing users to customize gestures for specific words or phrases.  

### Text-to-Speech Conversion  
- Integrated with the **Web Speech API**, the app converts translated text into natural-sounding speech, enabling seamless auditory communication.  

### Video Call Integration  
- Facilitates real-time communication through video calls, allowing users to express themselves using gestures.  

### User-Friendly Interface  
- Clean and intuitive design with gesture cards for easy learning and navigation.  
- One-click copy functionality for translated text, making it simple to share or save conversations.  

### Customizable Gesture Library  
- Users can add new gestures and retrain the AI model to improve accuracy and adapt to regional or personal sign language variations.  

### Lightweight and Efficient  
- Optimized for low memory usage, ensuring smooth performance on a wide range of devices.

## Technologies Used  
- **AI/ML Framework:** TensorFlow (for gesture classification).  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  
- **APIs:** Web Speech API (text-to-speech).  
- **Hosting:** Live demo hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How It Works  

### Step 1: Gesture Detection  
- The app uses the deviceâ€™s webcam to capture hand gestures in real-time.  
- TensorFlow processes the gestures and maps them to predefined or custom words/phrases.  

### Step 2: Text and Speech Output  
- The translated text is displayed on the screen.  
- The Web Speech API converts the text into speech, enabling auditory communication.  

### Step 3: Video Call Communication  
- Users can initiate video calls and communicate using gestures, making interactions more inclusive and dynamic.

## Impact  

### Education  
- Helps deaf students participate actively in classrooms by enabling real-time communication with teachers and peers.  

### Healthcare  
- Allows deaf patients to communicate symptoms and concerns effectively with healthcare providers.  

### Everyday Life  
- Facilitates seamless communication between deaf/mute individuals and the hearing world, promoting inclusivity in all aspects of life.

## Future Plans  

### Multilingual Support  
- Expand the app to support regional languages (e.g., Hindi, Marathi) and international sign languages.  

### Sentence-Level Translation  
- Enable the app to interpret complex gestures and full sentences for more natural communication.  

### Offline Mode  
- Develop an offline version of the app to ensure accessibility in areas with limited internet connectivity.  

### Mobile App Development  
- Create a mobile version of **Silent Bridge** for on-the-go communication.
